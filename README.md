## üìå Key Tasks & Features

### 1. Data Manipulation

**Customer Sheet:**
- Created a binary `Churned` column using the `IF` function (`Yes` ‚Üí `1`, `No` ‚Üí `0`).

**Aggregate Sheet:**
- Created `Demographics` column by grouping customers by age using nested `IF` function:
  - Under 30
  - Senior
  - Other
- Created `Grouped Consumption` column based on Avg Monthly GB Download using nested `IF` function:
  - 10 or more GB
  - Between 5 and 10 GB
  - Less than 5 GB

### 2. Pivot Table Analysis

**Customer Pivots:**
- Calculated KPIs:
  - Total Customers  
  - Churned Customers  
  - Churn Rate (%)  
- Analyzed churn reasons and visualized with bar charts.
- Explored churn categories to identify those with the highest proportion of churned customers.

**Churn Analysis:**
- Churn rate by age groups (Demographics) shown via pie chart.
- Detailed churn rate and number of customers by age brackets (19‚Äì88 in 10-year intervals) using clustered column and line chart.
- Churn rate by Unlimited Data Plan (Yes/No).
- Combined analysis of Unlimited Data Plan and Grouped Consumption shown in a stacked bar chart.
- Churn rate by state and International Plan with conditional formatting (Red-Yellow-Green scale).
- Churn rate by account length (in 12-month intervals) and contract type.

### 3. Dashboard
- Designed a clean, interactive Excel dashboard combining all visualizations and key metrics.
- Highlights actionable insights and trends in customer churn behavior.
